# Requirements

-   `ffmpeg`

# Setup

Create three folders: `cache`, `footage` and `output` in the root of the project (the same level as the source folder).

Place an mp4 video file containing your background footage in the footage file, the program is currently setup to expect a file named "minecraft.mp4" but this can be easily changed to whatever you want.
